		 -LinkedList - does it make any difference?
		    For the TestList class: based off of observations of time, the only difference was that array list took 1 ms longer to run
		 and for the TestIteraotr class: the linked list seems to run faster in comparison to the array list by 2 ms, this may be because the
		 iterator is more similiar to a linked list than the array list. But in reality, it depends on what the program is doing, so with this
		 program we are doing a lot of adding removing and testing, so the functionality that makes a linked list better or worst are not being tested.
		 The difference that would make a linked list better deals with how frequently data is being inserted and deleted
		 because with an array insertion and deletion is more complicated in comparison to a linked list. As we can see with the testIteraotr class
		 the linked list insertion and deletion seems to be more effective.


        - what happens if you use list.remove(77)?
            The program does not run, this is because list.Remove(77) removes the value at an index of 77, so when the program runs
            it says the index is out of bonds because there is nothing at an index of 77.

        - which of the two lists performs better as the size increases?
            Based off of the results of my graph it seems as though both perform equally as well throughout the tests.
